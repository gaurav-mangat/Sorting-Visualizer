# Sorting Visualizer

## Description
Sorting Visualizer is an interactive tool that allows users to visualize various sorting algorithms in action. The application helps users understand how different algorithms work by displaying the sorting process step-by-step.

## Features
- **Interactive Visualization:** See how sorting algorithms sort an array of numbers.
- **Multiple Algorithms:** Supports various sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, etc.
- **Customizable Input:** Users can input their own data or use random arrays for sorting.
- **Step-by-Step Execution:** Watch the sorting process in real-time to understand each algorithm's mechanics.
- **Responsive Design:** Works on various screen sizes and devices.

## Technologies Used
- Go (Golang) for backend logic
- HTML/CSS for frontend
- JavaScript for dynamic visualizations
